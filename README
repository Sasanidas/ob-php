Installation
============

Use MELPA to install `ob-php`.

Usage
=====

Because the option `-r` caused ob-php evaluation issue. So I disable it for now.

You must include `<? ... ?>` in src block now. Like this:

```org
#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php
echo "Hello, World!\n";
?>
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Hello, World!

```
